### Implementation

Fat Bat is written entirely in Objective-C. Custom UIViews, Core Animation, and Quartz 2D are used to render the game play. Other native libraries are used for audio playback and saving game state between sessions.

The interface and game play are consistent across all Apple devices (phone and tablet).

### Description
